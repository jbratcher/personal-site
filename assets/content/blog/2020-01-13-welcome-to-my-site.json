  "body": "Hi, I'm Jeremy and I'm a web developer of the full-stack variety residing in beautiful Louisville, KY.  \n\nI created this website to showcase my personal projects and share my thoughts and knowledge about web development.  \n\nI have a strong interest in web development as a whole and typically work the entire spectrum of the development process from design to markup to deployment.  I live to work with modern tools whether cutting- or bleeding-edge.  I also believe in open-source and all of my personal projects are open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/jbratcher).\n\nThe website itself was developed using the JAM stack specifically Vue and Netlify.  Modules include: Nuxt and Vuetify for Vue and Netlify CMS for Netlify.  \n\n\n\nLanguages I code:  \n\nJavascript, PHP, Go  \n\n\n\nTechnologies I use:  \n\nVue, Nuxt, Vuetify, AdonisJS, Laravel, SASS/SCSS, MySQL, MariaDB, (too many others too list)  \n\n\n\nThere are some 'hidden' easter egg animations on the homepage.  If you are curious to see them in action,  hovering or clicking on highlighted text with trigger an animation.\n\nThe website itself was developed using the [JAM stack](https://jamstack.org/) specifically Vue (Nuxt, Vuetify) and Netlify (Netlify CMS).",
