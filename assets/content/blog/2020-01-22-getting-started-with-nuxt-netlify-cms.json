  "body": "Recently, I wanted to add a CMS functionality to my website to blog and post personal projects.  I originally had the idea to develop it from scratch using a combination of AdonisJS for the API and Axios to fetch data client-side.   It took a week or two and I had myself a CMS from the ground up but I found myself reaching for things I hadn't included in my rudimentary design.\n\nSometimes you just want to get a static site with a CMS and dashboard up and running fast.  That's why I developed this Nuxt Netlify CMS starter kit.  \n\nBuilt with using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/), you can easily start building a static site right away.  It starts pre-configured for user auth and a basic blog module.  A Vuex store with modules is also available to use.  Nuxt lets you create pages which enables automatic routing even dynamic routes that need parameters.\n\nNuxt comes pre-configured but is highly configurable via \\`nuxt.config.js\\` and its [official and community modules](https://github.com/nuxt-community/awesome-nuxt#modules).\n\nWith Nuxt alone you can build an impressive site quickly and [Netlify CMS ](https://www.netlifycms.org/)allows you to easily add content to the blog module.\n\nNetlify CMS provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing content.  It also integrates nicely with git and services like Github and Gitlab allowing it to become part of your workflow.\n\nThis project can be deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with one click and local development is as easy as `yarn install` and `yarn dev`.\n\n[One click deploy to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jbratcher/nuxt-netlify-cms-starter-kit)",
