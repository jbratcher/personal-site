  "body": "Sometimes you just want to get a static site with a CMS dashboard up and running.  I've created a starter kit that will help you do just that.\n\nBuilt with using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/), you can easily start building a static site right away.  It starts pre-configured for user auth and a basic blog module.  A Vuex store with modules is also available to use.  Nuxt lets you create pages which enables automatic routing even dynamic routes that need parameters.\n\nWith Nuxt alone you can build an impressive static site and [Netlify CMS ](https://www.netlifycms.org/)allows you to easily add content to the blog module.\n\nThis project can be deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with one click and local development is as easy as `yarn install` and `yarn dev`.",
