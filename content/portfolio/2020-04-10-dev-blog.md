## Web Dev Blog

This is a framework/template to bootstrap your personal or professional portfolio and blog site. Quickly spin up a slick Vue SPA with a Laravel backend.

This project intends to create Laravel/Vue CMS for the pupose of a web developers blog and portfolio site.

Some features:

- User authentication
- SPA architecture for seemless loading and transitions, better user experience
- Full CRUD operations for resources
- Ability to add new resources to API easily by convenient naming conventions (ex. 'reesouce-item')
- User Dashboard and CMS for resources
- Markdown editor for easy resource creation and editing
- Database seeders for each resource
- Factory resource seeding from [picsum](picsum.com) and [pravatar](pravatar.com)
- Contact form messages to email

One goal of this project is to create an easy to learn and modify CMS framework that fulfills all the requriements of a professional web site for a web developer that has a blog, portfolio, and an online method of contact.

Attempts have been made to write models and components in a way to allow new resources to be easilty added and components to be reusable.

This is written as a monolith with the Vue SPA housed inside the Laravel app.

### Installation

Clone the repo locally and cd into the repo

```bash
