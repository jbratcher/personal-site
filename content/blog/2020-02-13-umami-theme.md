I'm a big fan of food in general and, here in Louisville, KY, over 100 new restaurants opened last year. We really have a thriving foodie culture. With all the new spots popping up, I decided to make a easy to use and customize theme for restaurants.

Like the [Direction Theme](https://www.jeremybratcher.com/blog/2020-02-02-direction-theme), this one is built on top of Nuxt for easy to manage pages and Netlify CMS for easy to manage content.

The dark and red theme is targeted to common branding colors in the restaurant industry.

The theme is fully responsive and mobile friendly.

The full screen hero video on the homepage should really catch the eye on large screen sizes.
