One of the biggest hurdles to starting new projects still seems to be setting up the environment and boilerplate code. I'm continuing to work on making these redundant practices less time consuming. So here is a more fleshed out though opinionated version of the Nuxt/Netlify CMS starter kit, Direction.

Direction is a simple but beautiful staticly generated site for conferences and events. You get a eye-catching hero as well as packages, speaker, sponsors, location, and blog sections. It is designed to make each section modular and easily swappable between sections and pages.

The layout is fully responsive and features both a blog and contact form controlled with Netlify CMS.

A lot of effort went into making this free but premium looking theme but it is by no means finished. Feel free to reach out or open an issue on the Github repo if you are interested in doing so.
